# CV_Challenge
Computer Vision Challenge SS25

This branch was created for the development of correspondence point detection. Specifically improving the robustness and accuracy through preprocessing steps or adaptive parameters. Some of the approaches explored here were experimental and were not pursued further, which is why they are not included in the main branch.
